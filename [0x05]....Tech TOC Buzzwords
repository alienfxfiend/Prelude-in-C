#List 20 or more sentences used to describe code for example "takes a pointer\ two arguments" and "returns an integer" —coding speak basically.
#List all sentences used to describe code for example "takes a pointer" and "returns an integer" coding speak basically.

Sure, here are some sentences used to describe code:

1. This code declares a variable of type integer.
2. The function takes in two parameters, a string and an integer.
3. This if statement checks if the value of x is greater than 5.
4. The for loop iterates over the length of the array.
5. The switch statement evaluates the value of the variable and executes the corresponding case.
6. The try-catch block catches any possible exceptions thrown by the code within the try block.
7. The while loop executes as long as the condition is true.
8. The code uses recursion to solve the problem.
9. The function returns a boolean value of true or false.
10. The class is instantiated with a constructor that takes in two parameters.
11. The method calculates the average of the input array.
12. The code block defines a new class that inherits from another class.
13. The constructor sets the initial value of the instance variables.
14. The function takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter.
15. The code initializes an array with preset values.
16. The pointer is dereferenced to access the actual value stored in memory.
17. The function returns a pointer to an object of the specified class.
18. The code creates a new instance of the class.
19. The if-else statement checks for multiple conditions and executes the appropriate code block.
20. The code implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of a specific value in an array.
21. The catch block handles the exception thrown by the try block.
22. The method sorts the elements in the array in ascending order.
23. The function takes an array of strings and returns the length of the longest string.
24. The code block creates an object of the specified class and initializes it with values passed in as parameters.
