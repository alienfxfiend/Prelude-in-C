        Intend to create an api hooking possibly running as a process or createremotethread app that runs as a service<br /><br />
                I'm working on an api hooking addon for yahoo messenger similar to ytunnel pro /w the voice features from ytk enhanced,and also similar to yahoo ace at the beginning,to keep things simple.I intend to code it entirely in visual basic (or vc++ if that is not possible) since this is the language i'll be learning.features will include custom spam bot filter table,voice dominance/mic locker/voice ignore,avatar support (cheetachat style),<br /><br />
